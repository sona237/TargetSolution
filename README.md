# TargetSolution
This project is a solution to case-study https://github.com/adityatummala/Android-Case-Study.

The sale price returned from API is null for some deals. In such cases actual price is being shown as sale price and actual price text is not struck off on deals details.

Please not url being used to generate deal images is not working (http://lorempixel.com/400/400/)
I have used url https://loremflickr.com/180/350/ instead to display deal images. So the images might not look very relevant but it is working well.


The solution follows MVVM architecture using Android Jetpack components.

Retrofit for API calls.

Stetho for debugging netwrok calls via Chrome.

Shimmer effect for laoding data placeholder.

Glide for loading images
